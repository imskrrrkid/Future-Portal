# Future Portal

**Future Portal** is a self-reflection tool designed to create a meaningful connection with your future self. This platform allows users to make a commitment or promise to their future by writing a message to themselves.

## How It Works

### 1. **Title & Email**
The user enters a **title** and **email address**, both of which will be associated with their promise. The email serves as a reminder and backup for the promise.

### 2. **Message to Future Self**
In the **text area**, the user is invited to write something meaningful—whether it's a personal goal, a motivational statement, or a message that their future self would want to share with their present self.

### 3. **Make a Promise**
Once the user has composed their message, they can click the **Promise** button to finalize the commitment. This action generates an image containing the title, email, and the message, visually representing their promise to the future.

### 4. **Save & Reflect**
After making the promise, the user can download the image and save it to a location where they can revisit it later. This image serves as a reminder of their commitment, inspiring growth and accountability.

### 5. **Custom Date & Time**
The project allows the **date and time** to be customized, ensuring flexibility in creating the perfect moment to reflect on the commitment made.

## Purpose
The goal of **Future Portal** is to encourage users to reflect on their personal goals and commitments while providing a visual representation of their aspirations. It is a tool for self-accountability, motivation, and growth—an opportunity to visualize a better future and track progress towards it.
